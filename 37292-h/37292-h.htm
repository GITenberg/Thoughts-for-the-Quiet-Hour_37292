<h2>TO THE READER</h2>


<p>One of the brightest signs of the times is that many
Christians in our Young People's Societies and churches
are observing a "Quiet Hour" daily. In this age of
rush and activity we need some special call to go apart
and be alone with God for a part of each day. Any man
or woman who does this faithfully and earnestly cannot
be more than twenty-four hours away from God.</p>

<p>The selections given in this volume were first published
in the monthly issues of the "<i>Record of Christian
Work</i>," and were found very helpful for devotional
purposes. They are also a mine of thoughts, to light
up the verses quoted. Being of permanent value, it
has been thought desirable to transfer them from the
pages of the magazine to this permanent volume.</p>

<p>May they have a helpful ministry, leading many into
closer communion with God!</p>

<p>My Father, I am coming. Nothing on the mean plain
shall keep me away from the holy heights. Help me to
climb fast, and keep Thou my foot, lest it fall upon the
hard rock! At Thy bidding I come, so Thou wilt not
mock my heart. Bring with Thee honey from heaven,
yea, milk and wine, and oil for my soul's good, and stay
the sun in his course, or the time will be too short in
which to look upon Thy face, and to hear Thy gentle

without murmuring. On that day He will take

way? Oh, let me say to thee this morning, "The Lord
hath need of thee." It may seem to be only a little
thing He has for you to do, but it is an important one.
He has "need of thee." Turn not thy back upon Him;
put not thyself out of the way of being employed by
Him; do not begin by laying down laws for thyself as

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Many are the afflictions of the righteous, but the Lord delivereth

<p>All the afflictions of the righteous open out into
something glorious. The prisoner is not merely delivered,
but he finds an angel waiting for him at the door.
And with every deliverance comes a specific blessing.
One angel is named faith; another, love; another, joy;
another, longsuffering; another, gentleness; another,
goodness; another, meekness; another, temperance; another,
peace. Each of these graces says, "We have
come out of great tribulation."&mdash;<i>G. Bowen.</i></p>

This is the fulness and perfection of knowing God: so
to know Him that He Himself becomes our delight; so
to know Him that praise is sweetest, and fullest, and
freshest, and gladdest, when we sing of Him. He who
has learned this blessed secret carries the golden key of

of profound difficulty&mdash;leading them into a wedge from
which there is no escape; contriving a situation which
no human judgment would have permitted, had it been
previously consulted. The very cloud conducts them
thither. You may be thus involved at this very hour.
It does seem perplexing and very serious to the last degree;
but it is perfectly right. The issue will more
than justify Him who has brought you hither. It is a
platform for the display of His almighty grace and
power. He will not only deliver you, but in doing so He
will give you a lesson that you will never forget; and to
which, in many a psalm and song in after days, you will
revert. You will never be able to thank God enough
for having done just as He has.&mdash;<i>F. B. Meyer.</i></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Take good heed therefore unto your souls. Josh. xxiii. 11.</i> (<i>Margin.</i>)</p></div>

<p>Gold cannot be used for currency as long as it is
mixed with the quartz and rock in which it lies imbedded.
So your soul is useless to God till taken out from
sin and earthliness and selfishness, in which it lies
buried. By the regenerating power of the Spirit you
must be separated unto Christ, stamped with His image
and superscription, and made into a divine currency,
which shall bear His likeness among men. The Christian
is, so to speak, the circulating medium of Christ, the
coin of the realm by whom the great transactions of
mercy and grace to a lost world are carried on. As the
currency stands for the gold, so does the Christian
stand for Christ, representing His good and acceptable
will.&mdash;<i>A. J. Gordon.</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>He that is faithful in that which is least, is faithful also in much.
Luke xvi. 10.</i></p></div>

<p>The least action of life can be as surely done from
the loftiest motive as the highest and noblest. Faithfulness
measures acts as God measures them. True
conscientiousness deals with our duties as God deals
with them. Duty is duty, conscience is conscience,
right is right, and wrong is wrong, whatever sized type
they be printed in. "Large" and "small" are not
words for the vocabulary of conscience. It knows only
two words&mdash;right and wrong.&mdash;<i>Alex. McLaren.</i></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>My God shall supply all your need according to His riches in glory

<p>What a source&mdash;"God"! What a standard&mdash;"His
riches in glory"! What a channel&mdash;"Christ Jesus"!
It is your sweet privilege to place <i>all your need</i> over
against <i>His riches</i>, and lose sight of the former in the
presence of the latter. His exhaustless treasury is
thrown open to you, in all the love of His heart; go and
draw upon it, in the artless simplicity of faith, and you
will never have occasion to look to a creature-stream, or
lean on a creature-prop.&mdash;<i>C. H. M.</i></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Count it all joy when ye fall into divers temptations. James i. 2.</i></p></div>

<p>We cannot be losers by trusting God, for He is
honored by faith, and most honored when faith discerns
His love and truth behind a thick cloud of His ways
and providence. Happy those who are thus tried! Let
us only be clear of unbelief and a guilty conscience.
We shall hide ourselves in the rock and pavilion of the

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Blessed are they that have not seen, and yet have believed. John
xx. 29.</i></p></div>

<p>The seen are shadows: the substance is found in the
unseen.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. No doubt, in Christ, the foundation
of our faith is unseen; but so is that of yonder tower
that lifts its tall erect form among the waves over which
it throws a saving light. It appears to rest on the
rolling billows; but, beneath these, invisible and immovable,
lies the solid rock on which it stands secure;
and when the hurricane roars above, and breakers roar
below, I could go calmly to sleep in that lone sea tower.
Founded on a rock, and safer than the proudest palace
that stands on the sandy, surf-beaten shore, it cannot
be moved. Still less the Rock of Ages! Who trusts
in that is fit for death, prepared for judgment, ready
for the last day's sounding trumpet, since, "The Lord
redeemeth the soul of His servants, and none of them
that trust in Him shall be desolate."&mdash;<i>Guthrie.</i></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Herein is my Father glorified that ye bear much fruit. John xv. 8.</i></p></div>

<p>What a possibility, what an inspiration, that we can
enhance the glory of "our Father"! Our hearts leap
at the thought.</p>

<p>How can this be done? By bearing "leaves,"&mdash;a
<i>profession</i> of love for Him? No. By bearing <i>some</i>
fruit? No. "That ye bear <i>much</i> fruit." In the
abundance of the yield is the joy, the glory of the
husbandman. We should, therefore, aim to be extraordinary,
"hundred-fold" Christians, satisfied with none
but the largest yield. Our lives should be packed with
good deeds. Then at harvest time we can say, "Father,
I have glorified Thee on the earth!"&mdash;<i>W. Jennings.</i></p>

<p>There is a very beautiful device by which the Japanese
are accustomed to express their wishes for their friends.
It is the figure of a drum in which the birds have built
their nest. The story told of it is that once there lived
a good king, so anxiously concerned for the welfare
of his people that at the palace gate he set a drum,
and whoever had any wrong to be redressed or any
want, should beat the drum, and at once, by
day or night, the king would grant the suppliant
an audience and relief. But throughout the land there
reigned such prosperity and contentment that none
needed to appeal for anything, and the birds built their
nests within it and filled it with the music of their
song.</p>

<p>Such gracious access is granted to us even by the
King of Heaven, and day and night His ready hearing
and His help are within the reach of all that come to
Him; but of all men most blessed are they who have
found on earth a blessedness in which all want is forgotten,
and trust rests so assured of safety in the
Father's care that prayer gives place to ceaseless praise.

<p>The life of fellowship with God cannot be built up in
a day. It begins with the habitual reference of all to
Him, hour by hour, as Moses did in Egypt. But it
moves on to more and longer periods of communion;
and it finds its consummation and bliss in days and

<p>This is the prayer we need to pray for ourselves and
for one another, "Lord, open our eyes that we may see";
for the world all around us, as well as around the
prophet, is full of God's horses and chariots, waiting to
carry us to places of glorious victory. And when
our eyes are thus opened, we shall see in all the events
of life, whether great or small, whether joyful or sad, a
"chariot" for our souls. Everything that comes to us
becomes a chariot the moment we treat it as such; and,
on the other hand, even the smallest trial may be a
Juggernaut car to crush us into misery or despair if we
so consider them. It lies with each of us to choose
which they shall be. It all depends, not upon what
these events are, but upon how we take them. If we
lie down under them, and let them roll over us and
crush us, they become Juggernaut cars, but if we climb
up into them, as into a car of victory, and make them
carry us triumphantly onward and upward, they become
the chariots of God.&mdash;<i>Smith.</i></p>

Alpine country may look high when seen from the plain,
as long as the snowy summits are wrapped in mist; but
when a little puff of wind comes and clears away the fog
from the lofty peaks, nobody looks at the little green hills
in front. So the world's hindrances and the world's difficulties

often standing now on faith's lofty eminences, looking
for "the day of God"&mdash;the rising sun which is to set no
more in weeping clouds. Wondrous progression! How
will all earth's learning, its boasted acquirements and
eagle-eyed philosophy sink into the lispings of very infancy
in comparison with this manhood of knowledge!
Heaven will be the true "<i>Excelsior</i>," its song, "<i>a song

height of glory, and saying, as He said to Nathaniel,
"<i>Thou shalt see </i><span class="smcap">greater</span><i> things than these!</i>"&mdash;<i>Macduff.</i></p>

Father. It is a loving, deep, sweet, heart-touching

<p>A quiet hour spent alone with God at the beginning
of the day is the best beginning for the toils and cares
of active business. A brief season of prayer, looking
above for wisdom and grace and strength, and seeking
for an outpouring of the Holy Spirit, helps us to carry
our religion into the business of the day. It brings
joy and peace within the heart. And as we place all
our concerns in the care and keeping of the Lord, faithfully
striving to do His will, we have a joyful trust that
however dark or discouraging events may appear, our
Father's hand is guiding everything, and will give the
wisest direction to all our toils.&mdash;<i>Selected.</i></p>

<p>God's promises are ever on the ascending scale. One
leads up to another, fuller and more blessed than itself.
In Mesopotamia God said, "I will show thee the land."
At Bethel, "This is the land." Here, "I will give thee
all the land, and children innumerable as the grains of
sand." And we shall find even these eclipsed.</p>

<p>It is thus that God allures us to saintliness. Not
giving anything till we have dared to act&mdash;that He

<p>This suggests the rest into which our Good Shepherd
leads His flock. Life is not all toil. God gives us
many quiet resting-places in our pilgrim way.</p>

<p>Night is one of these, when, after the day's toil, struggle,
and exhaustion, we are led aside, and the curtains
are drawn to shut out the noise, and He giveth His
beloved sleep, in sleep giving the wonderful blessings
of renewal. The Sabbath is another of these quiet
resting-places. God would have us drop our worldly
tasks, and have a day for the refreshing of both body
and soul.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Friendship's trysts are also quiet
resting-places, where heart may commune with heart,
where Jesus comes, too, unseen, and gives His blessing.
All ordinances of Christian worship&mdash;seasons of prayer
and devotion, hours of communion with God&mdash;are quiet
resting-places.</p>

<p>Did it ever occur to you that if you do not hear God's

but because you are deaf; not because He has no answer
to give, but because you have not been listening

our work, and sometimes so busy with our praying, that
it does not occur to us to stop our own talking and listen
if God has some answer to give us with "the still
small voice"; to be passive, to be quiet, to do nothing,
say nothing, in some true sense think nothing; simply

That day never comes when the Lord Jesus is not at the

<p>Oh, the glory of the message! For fifteen centuries
Israel had a sanctuary with a Holiest of All, into which,

The other is free, and its deeds are great and precious.
From the blasted summit of the mountain which gendereth

but the power to keep all these laws must be sought on

<p>It has been well said that "earthly cares are a heavenly

see the love lining to our own particular chariot&mdash;it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>

human skill to carry the brimming cup of mortal joy

he declares, "In all things I am instructed both to be

little of God's grace; satisfied with earth, we are content
to do without heaven. Rest assured, it is harder to
know how to be full than it is to know how to be hungry,

<p>It is most needful for all servants of Christ to remember
that whenever the Lord places a man in a position
of responsibility, He will both fit him for it and maintain
him in it.</p>

<p>It is, of course, another thing altogether if a man will

<p>Jesus <i>constrained</i> them to go! One would think
that if ever there was the certain promise of success in
a mission, it was here. Surely, here, if anywhere, a
triumphant issue might have been confidently predicted;
and yet here, more than anywhere, there was seeming
failure. He sent them out on a voyage, and they met
such a storm as they had never yet experienced.</p>

<p>Let me ponder this, for it has been so with me, too.
I have sometimes felt myself impelled to act by an influence
which seemed above me&mdash;constrained to put to
sea. The belief that I was constrained gave me confidence,
and I was sure of a calm voyage. But the result
was outward failure. The calm became a storm; the sea
raged, the winds roared, the ship tossed in the midst of
the waves, and my enterprise was wrecked ere it could
reach the land.</p>

<p>Was, then, my divine command a delusion?</p>

<p>Nay; nor yet was my mission a failure. He did send
me on that voyage, but He did not send me for <i>my</i> purpose.
He had one end and I had another. My end

<p>Men are questioning now, as they never have questioned
before, whether Christianity is, indeed, the true
religion which is to be the salvation of the world.
Christian men, it is for us to give our bit of answer to
that question. It is for us, in whom the Christian
church is at this moment partially embodied, to declare
that Christianity, that the Christian faith, the Christian
manhood can do that for the world which the world
needs.</p>

<p>You ask, "What can I do?"</p>

<p>You can furnish one Christian life. You can furnish
a life so faithful to every duty, so ready for every service,
so determined not to commit every sin, that the
great Christian church shall be the stronger for your
living in it, and the problem of the world be answered,
and a certain great peace come into this poor, perplexed,

<p>The secret of walking closely with Christ, and working

His beloved. Let us but feel that He has set His heart
upon us, that He is watching us from those heavens
with tender interest, that He is working out the mystery

is following us day by day as a mother follows her babe
in his first attempt to walk alone, that He has set His
love upon us, and, in spite of ourselves, is working out
for us His highest will and blessing, as far as we will
let Him, and then nothing can discourage us. Our
hearts will glow with responsive love. Our faith will
spring to meet His mighty promises, and our sacrifices
shall become the very luxuries of love for one so dear.
This was the secret of John's spirit. "We have known

of the death-shadow; but never did the promises read so

<p>A glance at the words is enough to make us feel how

further from God's ideal concerning us. <i>Be of good

would be, you must be thankful for what you are."</p>

<p>Now the question is this&mdash;How can these two be reconciled?</p>

<p>It is only the religion of Jesus Christ that reconciles

He stays to look again, and yet again, and yet again,

He meets them without a touch of upbraiding,
without recalling a single memory of all His bitter suffering,
revealing Himself to the disciples with a tenderness
and blessedness indescribably beautiful.</p>

<p>How can He go till He has healed the Magdalene's

prayer. God may send either or both, as seemeth Him
good. He may send the north wind of conviction, to
bring us to repentance, or He may send the south wind
of love, to melt us into gratitude and holy joy. If we
often require the sharp blasts of trial to develop our
graces, do we not also need the warm south breezes of
His mercy? Do we not need the new sense of Christ's
presence in our hearts and the joys of the Holy Ghost?
Do we not need to be melted, yes, to be overpowered by
the love of Jesus?&mdash;<i>Theodore Cuyler.</i></p>

strength to bear it. The pressure is often the fence between<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
the narrow way of life and the broad road to ruin;
and if our Heavenly Father were to remove it, it might
be at the sacrifice of heaven. Oh, if God had removed
that thorny fence in answer, often to earnest prayers,
how many of us would now be castaways! How the
song of many a saint now in glory would be hushed!
How many a harp would be unstrung! How many a
place in the mansions of the redeemed would be unfilled!
If God answered all the prayers we put up to heaven, we
should need no other scourge. Blessed it is that we
have One who is too loving to grant what we too often
so rashly ask.&mdash;<i>F. Whitfield.</i></p>

<p>What a humble, what a modest sphere for the exercise
of faith! One would have said that the purpose
was quite disproportionate to the work. The ark was a
great undertaking, but what was it undertaken for? To
save his own family. Is so narrow a sphere worthy to
be the object of faith? Is so commonplace a scene as
the life of the family circle fit to be a temple for the service
of God?&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. My soul, when thou hast finished
thy prayers and ended thy meditations, do not say that
thou hast left the house of God. God's house shall to
thee be everywhere, and thine own house shall be a part<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
of it. Thou shalt feel that all the duties of this place
are consecrated; that it is none other than the house of
God and one of the gates to heaven. Thou shalt feel
that every one of its duties is an act of high communion.
Therefore be it thine to make thy house <i>His</i> house. Be
it thine to consecrate each word and look and deed in
the social life of home. Be it thine to build thine ark
of refuge for the wants of common day; verily, thy labor
of love shall be called an act of faith.&mdash;<i>George

He trod the pathway of our world. And in this forgetfulness
how much we miss! What He was, that He is.
What He said, that He says. The Gospels are simply
specimens of the life that He is ever living; they are
leaves torn out of the diary of His unchangeable Being.
To-day He is engaged in washing the feet of His disciples,
soiled with their wilderness journeyings. Yes,
that charming incident is having its fulfilment in thee,
my friend, if only thou dost not refuse the lowly loving
offices of Him whom we call Master and Lord, but who
still girds Himself and comes forth to serve. And we
must have this incessant cleansing if we would keep
right. It is not enough to look back to a certain hour
when we first knelt at the feet of the Son of God for
pardon; and heard Him say, "Thy sins, which are many,

<p>Prayer is the forerunner of mercy. Turn to sacred
history and you will find that scarcely ever did a great
mercy come to this world unheralded by supplication.
Prayer is always the preface to blessing. It goes before
the blessing <i>as the blessing's shadow</i>. When the sunlight
of God's mercies rises upon our necessities it casts
the shadow of prayer far down upon the plain. Or, to
use another illustration, when God piles up a hill of
mercies He Himself shines behind them, and He casts
on our spirits the shadow of prayer so that we may rest
certain, if we are much in prayer, our pleadings are the
shadows of mercy. Prayer is thus connected with the
blessing to show us the value of it.&mdash;<i>Spurgeon.</i></p>

<p>In some of the great halls of Europe may be seen
pictures not painted with the brush, but mosaics, which
are made up of small pieces of stone, glass, or other
material. The artist takes these little pieces, and, polishing
and arranging them, he forms them into the
grand and beautiful picture. Each individual part of
the picture may be a little worthless piece of glass
or marble or shell; but, with each in its place, the whole
constitutes the masterpiece of art.</p>

<p>So I think it will be with humanity in the hands of
the great Artist. God is picking up the little worthless
pieces of stone and brass that might be trodden under
foot unnoticed, and is making of them His great masterpiece.&mdash;<i>Bishop

You go to it some morning when a fire breaks out in

himself what seems a creed of faith, a trust in God in
anticipation of the day when danger is to overtake him,
and has said to himself, I am safe, for I will take refuge

in the shadow of Thy wings will I rejoice."&mdash;<i>R.

<p>We go home without arrangement. We plan our
visits, and then go home because they are over. Duty,
want, a host of things, lead us forth elsewhere; but the
heart takes us home. Blessed, most blessed is he whose
thoughts pass up to God, not because they are driven
like a fisherman's craft swept by the fierceness of the
storm, not because they are forced by want or fear, not
because they are led by the hand of duty, but because
God is in his habitation and his home. Loosed from
other things, the thoughts go home for rest.</p>

<p>In God the blessed man finds the love that welcomes.
There is the sunny place. There care is loosed and toil
forgotten. There is the joyous freedom, the happy calm,
the rest, and renewing of our strength&mdash;at home with
God.&mdash;<i>Mark Guy Pearse.</i></p>

spiritual blessing God will touch it. It may be as <i>small</i>
a thing as a sinew; but its influence in making a man

condemn it&mdash;and God will touch it. And beneath that

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost. 2
Pet. i. 21.</i></p></div>

<p>The Bible is the writing of the living God. Each
letter was penned with an almighty finger. Each word
in it dropped from the everlasting lips. Each sentence
was dictated by the Holy Spirit. Albeit that Moses
was employed to write his histories with his fiery pen,
God guided that pen. It may be that David touched
his harp, and let sweet psalms of melody drop from his
fingers; but God moved his hands over the living strings
of his golden harp. Solomon sang canticles of love
and gave forth words of consummate wisdom; but God
directed his lips, and made the preacher eloquent. If
I follow the thundering Nahum, when his horses plough
the waters; or Habakkuk, when he sees the tents of
Cushan in affliction; if I read Malachi, when the earth
is burning like an oven; if I turn to the smooth page of
John, who tells of love; or the rugged chapters of Peter,
who speaks of fire devouring God's enemies; if I turn
aside to Jude, who launches forth anathemas upon the
foes of God&mdash;everywhere I find God speaking; it is
God's voice, not man's; the words are God's words; the
words of the Eternal, the Invisible, the Almighty, the
Jehovah of ages. This Bible is God's Bible; and when
I see it, I seem to hear a voice springing up from it, saying,
"I am the Book of God. Man, read me. I am
God's writing. Study my page, for I was penned by
God. Love me, for He is my Author, and you will see
Him visible and manifest everywhere."&mdash;<i>Spurgeon.</i></p>

Christ looked to heaven and said, "Father." Let us
imitate Him; although standing on the earth, let us
have our conversation in heaven. Before you go out, if
you would feed the world, if you would be a blessing in
the midst of spiritual dearth and famine, lift up your
head to heaven. Then your very face will shine, your
very garments will smell of myrrh and aloes and cassia

They are hidden among the leaves. The little birds
know where they are; and when a storm arises, or when
night draws on, they fly, each to his own nest. So the
promises of God are hidden in the Bible, like nests in
the great forests; and thither we should fly in any danger
or alarm, hiding there in our soul's nest until the
storm be overpast. There are no castles in this world
so impregnable as the words of Christ.&mdash;<i>J. R. Miller.</i></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>A hearer of the word .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. a doer of the work. Jas. i. 23, 25.</i></p></div>

<p>Religion may be learned on Sunday, but it is lived in
the week-day's work. The torch of religion may be lit
in the church, but it does its burning in the shop and
on the street. Religion seeks its life in prayer, but it
lives its life in deeds. It is planted in the closet, but it
does its growing out in the world. It plumes itself for
flight in songs of praise, but its actual flights are in
works of love. It resolves and meditates on faithfulness
as it reads its Christian lesson in the Book of
Truth, but "faithful is that faithful does." It puts its
armor on in all the aids and helps of the sanctuary as
its dressing-room, but it combats for the right, the
noble, and the good in all the activities of practical
existence, and its battle ground is the whole broad field
of life.&mdash;<i>John Doughty.</i></p>

<p>Our prayers often resemble the mischievous tricks of

waiting for entrance and answer, we act as if we were

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>A multitude of the heavenly host praising God, and saying, Glory to
God in the highest. Luke ii. 13, 14.</i></p></div>

<p>Angels had been present on many august occasions,
and they had joined in many a solemn chorus to the
praise of their Almighty Creator. They were present
at the creation: "The morning stars sang together, and
all the sons of God shouted for joy." They had seen
many a planet fashioned between the palms of Jehovah,
and wheeled by His eternal hands through the infinitude
of space. They had sung solemn songs over many
a world which the Great One had created. We doubt
not, they had often chanted, "Blessing and honor, and
glory, and majesty, and power, and dominion, and might,
be unto Him that sitteth on the throne," manifesting
Himself in the work of creation. I doubt not, too, that
their songs had gathered force through ages. As when
first created, their first breath was song, so when they
saw God create new worlds, then their song received
another note; they rose a little higher in the gamut of
adoration. But this time, when they saw God stoop<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
from His throne and become a babe hanging upon a
woman's breast, they lifted their notes higher still; and
reaching to the uttermost stretch of angelic music, they
gained the highest notes of the divine scale of praise
and they sang, "Glory to God <i>in the highest</i>," for
higher in goodness they felt God could not go. Thus
their highest praise they gave to Him in the highest act
of His Godhead.&mdash;<i>Spurgeon.</i></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>God forbid that I should glory save in the cross of our Lord Jesus
Christ. Gal. vi. 14.</i></p></div>

<p>The cross is the great center of God's moral universe!
To this center God ever pointed, and the eye of faith
ever looked forward, until the Savior came. And now
we must ever turn to that cross as the center of all our
blessing, and the basis of all our worship, both on earth
and in heaven&mdash;in time and throughout all eternity.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>He ever liveth. Heb. vii. 25.</i></p></div>

<p>It is our hope for ourselves, and for His truth, and
for mankind. Men come and go. Leaders, teachers,
thinkers, speak and work for a season, and then fall
silent and impotent. He abides. They die, but He
lives. They are lights kindled, and therefore, sooner or

<p>It is like the ivy with the oak. The ivy may give the
oak a grand, beautiful appearance, but all the while it
is feeding on its vitals. Are we compromising with the
enemies of God? Are we being embraced by the world
by its honors, its pleasures, its applause? This may
add to us in the world's estimation, but our strength
becomes lost.&mdash;<i>Denham Smith.</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<p>For real business at the mercy-seat give me a home-made
prayer, a prayer that comes out of the depths of
my heart, not because I invented it, but because God
the Holy Ghost, put it there, and gave it such living
force that I could not help letting it out. Though your
words are broken, and your sentences disconnected, if
your desires are earnest, if they are like coals of juniper,
burning with a vehement flame, God will not mind how
they find expression. If you have no words, perhaps
you will pray better without them than with them.
There are prayers that break the backs of words; they

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
